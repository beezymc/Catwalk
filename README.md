# Catwalk

## Overview
This project is the front-end web portal of a product view page for an ecommerce website. 

## Description
Catwalk allows users to view a product, see related products, and write questions and answers directed at the selected product. The project also includes the client-side server, which then connects to an external API provided by the project issuer for any CRUD operations.

## Installation: Development
NOTE: External API requires a key to connect; this project will not function without that access.
1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Install dependencies using 'npm install'
3. Include a github token, the path to the API, and the Port number within the config.js file where indicated.
4. Open two terminals
5. Within one terminal, run 'npm run start' to start the server
6. Within the other, run 'npm run react-dev' to start the client
7. Navigate to your favored localhost port (as noted in the config).

## Installation: Production
